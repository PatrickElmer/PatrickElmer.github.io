## Patrick Elmer

I am a PhD student in Historical Linguistics at [The Graduate University for Advanced Studies](www.soken.ac.jp/en), Campus at [Minpaku](www.minpaku.ac.jp/en), Osaka, Japan. My dissertation project [_Proto-Japonic Origins in the Yangtze Delta: Comparing Rice-related Lexicon of Proto-Japonic with Those in the Language Families of East Asia_](https://www.minpaku.ac.jp/post-student/14845) deals with the origins of the Japonic language family.

### About me

I am a historical linguist with focus on the Japonic language family (Japanese and the Ryūkyū languages) from Austria <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" id="picture" height="9" viewbox="0 0 8 6">
<path fill="currentColor" d="M0 0h8v6H0z"/>
<path fill="#fff" d="M0 2h8v2H0z"/>
</svg>. ​My general research deals with prehistorical language contact in East Asia. The main focus is on the language families of East Asia, such as Japonic, Austronesian, Kradai and Hmong-Mien.

My work mainly uses the comparative method for reconstructing and comparing vocabulary from proto-languages. I apply the traditional comparative method as a computer-assisted approach, whereby I intend to make the method more objective and efficient.
