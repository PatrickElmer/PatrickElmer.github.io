#### On the Origins of the Japanese Language

In this article, I deal with the historical development of the Japanese language by applying a multi-disciplinary approach that uses data from a variety of fields. My research indicates that the home-land of the Japonic language family may have been in the lower Yangtze River Valley, from where its speakers moved to the Korean Peninsula and eventually to Japan during the Yayoi period. This spread is associated with the dispersal of wet rice agriculture from the area south of the Yangtze River via the northeastern Asian mainland, where it was in contact with cultures cultivating millet. Old Japanese mythology and genealogical data suggests that the earliest known ethnic group that spoke Japonic may have been the Hayato people of southern Kyūshū.

#### Origins of the Japanese languages - A multidisciplinary approach (Japanese Studies)

Numerous studies on the origins of the Japanese languages have failed to deliver a satisfactory answer. This is in part due to the complex nature of the problem. In this thesis I have applied a multidisciplinary approach to utilize data from a variety of fields that provide a versatile picture of the historical development of the Japanese language. My research suggests that the homeland of the Japonic language family may have been in the lower Yangtze River Valley, from where its speakers moved to the Korean peninsula and eventually into Japan during the Yayoi period. This spread is associated with the dispersal of wet-rice agriculture from the area south of the Yangtze River via the northeastern Asian mainland, where it was in contact with cultures cultivating millets, and through the Korean peninsula. The people from the supposed homeland are likely related to the Pre-Austronesians. Therefore, this hypothesis can be tested in future research by locating language data for Pre-Austronesian and comparing them with reconstructed proto-Japonic terms.

#### Dating the split of the Japonic language family. The Pre-Old Japanese corpus (Historical Linguistics)

Japanese is considered to belong to the Japonic language family with the Ryūkyūan languages south of mainland Japan. The historic relationship between Japanese and Ryūkyūan is not fully understood yet, but researchers generally agree that they must have split before the Old Japanese corpus was recorded in the eighth century CE. In this paper I have reconstructed some of the Japonic language fragments from the Chinese text called Gishi-Wajinden (third century CE) based on the reconstruction of Later Han Chinese and Old Japanese phonology. The data was analyzed regarding the dating of the split of the Japonic language family into the Japanese and Ryūkyūan branches. For example, the Pre-Old Japanese word *pi ‘sun’ can be connected to cultural influence from the Korean peninsula. Since some Ryūkyūan languages have another word for ‘sun,’ which can be reconstructed as *tida for Proto-Ryūkyūan, I assume that the original Ryūkyūan speakers spread southward from the Japanese mainland before the third century. This also suggests that there was considerable contact between the Ryūkyū islands and mainland Japan, which is how cultural vocabulary from the Korean peninsula may have reached the Ryūkyū islands.
